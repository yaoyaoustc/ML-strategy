# Phase 2: Data Understanding

## Data Collection
1. Detail various sources and steps to extract data
e.g. object detection training data: vision camera/infrared camera

2. Analyze data for additional requirements
e.g. Data encoding/ merging/ obtain more data

3. Consider other data sources
e.g. Online public dataset, customer's domain knowledge.

## Data Properties
1. Describe the data, amount of the data used, and metadata properties
e.g. vision camera data, resolution, length, clips, tables?

2. Find key features and relationships in the data
e.g. object detection requires training data available. data needs to be labelled. 

3. Use tools and techniques to explore data properties
e.g. jupyter notebook. Azure data lake. Spark. Reporting tools.

## Data Quality
1. Verifying attributes
e.g. if camera data is correctly ingested.

2. Identifying missing data
e.g. if the data of all weather conditions are properly collected? missing data filling.

3. Reveal inconsistencies
e.g. Some of the data with one resolution, other data has another resolution.

4. Report solution
e.g. discard the data with bad resolution.
