# Phase 1: Business Understanding

## Understanding business requirements
1. Understand business requirements
e.g. A marine navigation company needs to integrate ML techniques into their navigation product. They want to build a application which can help improve the captain's situation awareness.

2. Form a business question
e.g. How ML can help improve the captain's situation awareness?

3. Hightlight project's critical features
e.g. People: ML engineers, data engineers. Resources: Azure ML

## Analyzing supporting information
1. List required resources and assumptions
e.g. resources: people, computational resources, hardware requirements,on-site tests on a boat, etc.

2. Analyze associated risks
e.g. business risks: fail to deploy the solution/solution doesn't work well/customer latency

3. Plan for contingencies
e.g. 

4. Compare costs and benefits
e.g. estimate azure/aws/gcp costs based on the resources. estimate the profit introduced by the new product

## Converting to a Data Mining problem
1. Review machine learning question
e.g. The questions is: We need a product can help improve captain's situation awareness

2. Create technical data mining objective
the nature of the problem(supervised/unsupervised, classification/regression)
e.g. This question can be converted to a ML problem: use object detection method to detect objects on the surface, highlight it on a video stream to help the captain be aware of the surroundings.

3. Define the criteria for successful outcome of the project
e.g. A iPAD application is developed to use object detection method to detect objects on the surface of the sea.

## Preparing a preliminary plan
1. Number and duration of stages:
e.g. stage 1: discovery spike. stage 2: basic demo roll out. stage 3: more features and further development.

2. Dependencies:
e.g. Hardware requirements. Personal requirements. 

3. Risks:
e.g. rough weather condition decrease the performance.

4. Goals:
e.g.A iPAD application is developed to use object detection method to detect objects on the surface of the sea. 

5. Evaluation methods:
e.g. Fail to identify a boat or miss-identify something else as a boat? or both?

6. Tools and techniques:
e.g. object detection model. framework (darknet/tensorflow/pytorch). deployment method.
