# ML hardware:
CPU, GPU, FPGA

CPU:
- fewer cores, but more powerful cores.
GPU: 
- Lots of cores, but dumber cores.
- Nvidia V.S. AMD
    - Nvidia:
         GTX 1080 Ti => Titan RTX (tensor core: specialized hardware for 4x4 matrix multiply, mixed precision)
    - Programming GPUs:
        - CUDA (Nvidia only): c like code runs directly on GPU. 
        - OpenCL: similar to CUDA but runs on anything. 
FPGA:
- An FPGA provides an extremely low-latency, flexible architecture that provides deep learning acceleration in a power-efficient solution.
